<h2>Version 2.2.0</h2>

This update brings a lot of bug fixes and overall stability improvements. Now, development will finally be focused on adding new features.
- Removed ”show icons on hover” due to too much CPU usage.
- CPU usage is now significantly less when listening for click on empty space on the menu bar.
- Dozer will not be triggered unintentionally on drag.
- Improved onboarding.
- Improved prompting for accessibility access.
- Fixed bug where the Dozer preferences window randomly disappeared when clicking the Dozer menu bar icon.
- Fixed update alert, so it will not be hidden behind Dozer preferences window.
- Fixed click detection on menu bar empty space with multiple screens.
- Fixed issue where dozer would be triggered unintentionally when in fullscreen.

I have decided to only publish the compiled app for now. I will share the codebase later on, when it is more organized, so people actually can understand how the code works, and eventually help to develop the app. It takes time to keep the code synced with Github, and I would rather use that time developing the app.
